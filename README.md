# PROJECT TITLE:"House Price Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor: A Machine Learning Approach"




## Project Objectives


Understand the Data:

Load and explore the Boston Housing dataset.
Inspect the dataset structure, summary statistics, and check for missing values.
# Feature Relationships:

Analyze the correlation between variables using a heatmap to identify influential features.
# Model Implementation:

Train a Random Forest Regressor to predict house prices based on features like crime rate, number of rooms, and proximity to amenities.
# Model Evaluation:

Assess the model's accuracy using evaluation metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
# Feature Importance:

Visualize the importance of different features in predicting house prices to understand their impact.
# Prediction on New Data:

Use the trained model to predict the price of a new house based on its characteristics.

# Libraries Used
## pandas:

For data manipulation and analysis.
Used to load the dataset, explore the data, and perform operations like feature selection.
## numpy:

For numerical computations and calculations like square root for RMSE.
## seaborn:

For statistical data visualization.
Used to plot a correlation heatmap for understanding relationships between variables.
## matplotlib:

For creating visualizations such as the correlation heatmap and feature importance bar chart.
## scikit-learn:

For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
Includes:
train_test_split: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
RandomForestRegressor: Implements the Random Forest algorithm for regression.
Metrics: Evaluate model performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared
